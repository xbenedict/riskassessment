# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Heritage Guardian is an interactive web application designed to help cultural heritage professionals assess, visualize, and manage risks to heritage sites. The application will focus on providing comprehensive risk assessment tools using both qualitative and quantitative methodologies (ABC scale system), real-time data integration through web scraping, and interactive visualizations to support decision-making for heritage site conservation and management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a heritage site manager, I want to perform comprehensive risk assessments using the ABC scale methodology, so that I can quantify and prioritize threats to my heritage site.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the risk assessment module THEN the system SHALL display input forms for probability (A), loss of value (B), and fraction affected (C) components
2. WHEN a user enters values for A, B, and C components THEN the system SHALL automatically calculate the magnitude of risk (MR = A + B + C)
3. WHEN the risk magnitude is calculated THEN the system SHALL categorize the risk into one of five priority levels (extremely high, very high, high, medium/high, low)
4. WHEN multiple risks are assessed THEN the system SHALL display them in a prioritized list based on their magnitude scores
5. IF uncertainty levels are specified THEN the system SHALL apply the uncertainty matrix to adjust priority recommendations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to access real-time information about heritage sites and threats, so that I can make informed decisions based on current data and research.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user searches for a heritage site THEN the system SHALL use web scraping to retrieve relevant information from authoritative sources
2. WHEN site information is retrieved THEN the system SHALL display historical data, current threats, and conservation status
3. WHEN threat data is gathered THEN the system SHALL automatically suggest risk assessment parameters based on similar sites
4. WHEN new information is found THEN the system SHALL update the site database and notify relevant users
5. IF external data sources are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options and cached data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a conservation professional, I want to visualize risk data through interactive charts and maps, so that I can better understand threat patterns and communicate findings to stakeholders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN risk assessments are completed THEN the system SHALL generate interactive charts showing risk distribution and priorities
2. WHEN viewing site data THEN the system SHALL display geographic visualizations showing site locations and threat zones
3. WHEN comparing multiple sites THEN the system SHALL provide comparative analysis charts and dashboards
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL create exportable visualizations and data summaries
5. IF real-time data is available THEN the system SHALL update visualizations automatically

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a heritage site administrator, I want to manage multiple heritage sites and their risk profiles, so that I can oversee conservation efforts across my portfolio of sites.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs into the system THEN the system SHALL display a dashboard with all managed heritage sites
2. WHEN adding a new site THEN the system SHALL allow input of site details, location, and initial risk factors
3. WHEN viewing a site profile THEN the system SHALL show comprehensive risk history, current status, and recommended actions
4. WHEN risks change THEN the system SHALL send notifications and update priority rankings
5. IF multiple users manage the same site THEN the system SHALL provide collaborative features and access controls

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a policy maker, I want to access standardized risk reports and analytics, so that I can make informed decisions about resource allocation and policy development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL create standardized risk assessment reports following international guidelines
2. WHEN analyzing trends THEN the system SHALL provide temporal analysis showing risk evolution over time
3. WHEN comparing regions THEN the system SHALL generate comparative analytics across different heritage sites
4. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL support multiple formats (PDF, Excel, JSON) for integration with other systems
5. IF policy changes are needed THEN the system SHALL highlight critical risk areas requiring immediate attention

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a field researcher, I want to input and update risk data from mobile devices, so that I can conduct assessments directly at heritage sites.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the app on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive interface optimized for field use
2. WHEN conducting field assessments THEN the system SHALL allow offline data entry with synchronization when connectivity returns
3. WHEN documenting threats THEN the system SHALL support photo uploads and GPS location tagging
4. WHEN updating risk factors THEN the system SHALL immediately recalculate risk magnitudes and update priorities
5. IF connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL cache data locally and sync when connection improves
